# HN Bot

A simple bot built on Python to fetch posts from the public HN API endpoint and post them to a telegram group (meaning no ads).
You can join the TG channel @distraction_free_hacker_news if you want. You don't have to though.

Mostly a toy project to play around with async programming and end to end CI/CD deployment.
And so I don't bait myself into reading comments on HN since it does not post a link to the comments, meaning I can't ragebait myself on the average commenter's terrible comment but read the actual article. Call that anti-redditification.
